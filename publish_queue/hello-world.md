# Hello World

This is a test post to verify the Model Citizen publishing pipeline is working correctly.

## What is Model Citizen?

Model Citizen is a public knowledge garden that shows how ideas develop from raw sources to published articles. It combines:

- An **Obsidian vault** where I capture and process sources
- A **Quartz site** where approved content gets published
- **n8n automation** that handles daily ingestion and enrichment

## Why Public?

Unlike polished blogs that hide the messy thinking, Model Citizen shows everything:
- Raw source captures
- AI-enriched summaries
- Idea cards and drafts
- The explicit approval process

This transparency is intentional. It signals intellectual honesty and lets others see how ideas evolve.

## Next Steps

This hello world post confirms the basic infrastructure works. Future phases will add:
- YouTube transcript ingestion
- Claude-powered enrichment
- Human review workflows
- Automated publishing sync
